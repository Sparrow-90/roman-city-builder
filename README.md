Salve Citizen!

I invite you to play the role of a Roman architect whose task is to beautify a Roman town.
there are already a few buildings there, but the most important ones are still missing.


The mechanics are very simple:
click on the building in the panel on the right and drag it to the correct field on the map.


In addition, by clicking on a building or a card with the name of the building, 
you will open a panel with interesting facts about each of them.


Have fun!
